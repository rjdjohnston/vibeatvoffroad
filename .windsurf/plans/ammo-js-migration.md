## Ammo.js Migration Plan for Enhanced Physics

### Key Components to Migrate
- ATV vehicle physics (chassis, wheels)
- Terrain/track collision system
- Ramp physics (red, green, blue, yellow)
- Height map terrain system
- Ground plane collision

### Implementation Phases
1. **Setup** (1-2 days)
   - Replace CANNON.js with Ammo.js
   - Basic physics world setup
   - Initial testing

2. **Core Physics** (3-4 days)
   - Vehicle physics implementation
   - Terrain collision system
   - Movement and stability testing

3. **Advanced Features** (4-5 days)
   - Heightfield terrain implementation
   - Ramp physics
   - Physics parameter tuning

4. **Polish** (2-3 days)
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes
   - Final physics adjustments

### Expected Benefits
- More accurate vehicle physics
- Better terrain interaction
- Improved stability at high speeds
- Advanced features (soft-body physics, better collision detection)
- More realistic suspension system

### Technical Considerations
- Manual memory management required
- More complex vehicle setup
- Different approach to constraints and forces
- Performance optimization for heightfield resolution

Total estimated timeline: 10-14 days for full migration
