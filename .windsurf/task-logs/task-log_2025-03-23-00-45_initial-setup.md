# Task Log: Initial Windsurf Memory System Setup

GOAL: Set up the Windsurf Memory System for the Vibe ATV Off-road project and document the existing codebase.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Created the `.windsurf` directory structure with required subdirectories
- Established core Memory Bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Defined project overview, requirements, goals, and scope
  - `productContext.md`: Documented why the project exists and user experience goals
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Mapped out the system architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md`: Detailed technologies, constraints, and dependencies
  - `activeContext.md`: Outlined current focus and potential enhancements
  - `progress.md`: Tracked current status, working features, and future development
- Performed initial codebase analysis to understand:
  - 3D environment and track design
  - ATV model loading and physics integration
  - Animation loop and rendering pipeline
  - User controls and camera system
  - Visual effects implementation

COMPLETED: 2025-03-23-00-45

PERFORMANCE: 8/10
- Successfully established the complete Windsurf Memory System structure
- Thoroughly documented existing code functionality and architecture
- Created comprehensive planning documents for future development
- Identified potential areas for enhancement and improvement

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Consider creating a more detailed technical plan for specific enhancements
2. Explore the functionality in script2.js and script_track_bkg.js
3. Prioritize potential improvements based on user experience impact
4. Document any specific issues that should be addressed in the codebase
