# Task Log: 3D Track Implementation

GOAL: Replace the existing flat terrain and simple oval track with a 3D modeled drift race track (drift_race_track.glb)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Removed the existing flat terrain plane and oval track with jumps
- Loaded the 3D drift race track model from models/tracks/drift_race_track.glb
- Created a physics implementation for the 3D track using CANNON.js Trimesh approach
- Added vertices and indices extraction from the 3D model geometry
- Implemented fallback physics (simple ground plane) in case of trimesh creation issues
- Adjusted the ATV starting position to match the new track layout
- Updated camera settings to focus on the new track center
- Modified reset positions for when the ATV falls off the track

COMPLETED: 2025-03-23-00-50

PERFORMANCE: 8/10
- Successfully implemented the 3D track model replacement
- Created a trimesh-based physics system that follows the track's geometry
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback physics
- Ensured smooth testing via local web server
- Physics representation might need further tuning for optimal performance

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Fine-tune the track's scale, position, and rotation for optimal gameplay
2. Adjust physics parameters to match the track's characteristics
3. Consider adding track boundaries or visual indicators
4. Optimize the physics trimesh for better performance
5. Consider adding track-specific features (start/finish line, checkpoints)
