# Task Log: Arrow Key Controls Implementation

GOAL: Add arrow key support alongside WASD keys for controlling the ATV.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Modified the keydown event listener to recognize both WASD keys and arrow keys
- Modified the keyup event listener to handle both WASD keys and arrow keys
- Maintained the same control mapping (Up/W for forward, Down/S for backward, Left/A for left, Right/D for right)
- Used switch case with multiple cases per action to keep code organized and maintainable
- Ensured proper case sensitivity using 'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight' for the arrow keys

COMPLETED: 2025-03-23-01-23

PERFORMANCE: 10/10
- Successfully implemented arrow key support without modifying the existing WASD controls
- Code is clean and follows the same pattern as the original implementation
- The solution is efficient with no duplicated event handlers
- Controls work immediately with no need to refresh or reload the game

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Consider adding visual indicators for controls in the UI
2. Potentially implement touch/mobile controls for wider accessibility
3. Add support for gamepad/controller input
4. Consider adding a control settings menu to allow key rebinding
