# Task Log: Dynamic Tilting Physics

GOAL: Implement natural tilting during turns while maintaining overall stability for the ATV.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Reduced angular damping from 0.99 to 0.8 to allow more natural tilting motion
- Added a slight center of mass offset (0.1 units) for better weight distribution
- Implemented dynamic lean forces that activate when turning at speed (velocity > 5)
- Created directional lean forces for left and right turns that scale with velocity
- Set a lean factor that increases with speed (up to a maximum of 500)
- Used the actual ATV velocity to determine lean strength for more realistic handling
- Reduced reverse speed power (3x multiplier vs 5x for forward) for better control
- Kept the wider and flatter chassis (1.5, 0.3, 2.0) for baseline stability

PERFORMANCE: 8/10
- Successfully created a balance between stability and dynamic movement
- The ATV now leans naturally into turns at speed for a more engaging experience
- Maintained core stability to prevent complete rollovers
- Created a more game-like feel with realistic-looking but controlled physics
- The solution scales with vehicle speed for better driving dynamics

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Fine-tune the lean factor scaling (currently 0.5 * velocity) based on player feedback
2. Consider adding visual effects that correspond to the leaning motion
3. Experiment with different lean behaviors for different terrain types
4. Add an option to adjust the tilt sensitivity for player preference
5. Implement a recovery mechanic for when the ATV does roll over
