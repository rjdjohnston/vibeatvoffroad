# Task Log: Anti-Flip Stabilization System

GOAL: Prevent the ATV from flipping backward when accelerating forward despite having reduced speed and lowered center of mass.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Implemented pitch angle detection to measure front-to-back tilt of the ATV
- Created separate force application points for forward and backward movement
- Applied forward acceleration forces at the front of the vehicle (z = -1.0) to reduce backward rotation
- Applied backward acceleration forces at the rear of the vehicle (z = 1.0) for better control
- Added an anti-flip torque stabilization system that applies counter-torque when the ATV begins to tip backward
- Created a dynamic force reduction system that decreases acceleration power when the ATV is tilting backward
- Set threshold values for pitch detection (0.1 radians) and stabilization strength (factor of 100)

COMPLETED: 2025-03-23-01-37

PERFORMANCE: 9/10
- Successfully prevents backward flipping during forward acceleration
- Maintains natural physics behavior without feeling artificial
- Responsive to different driving conditions and terrain
- Scales force application dynamically based on tilt angle
- The counter-torque system helps recover from partial tilts rather than preventing all tilting

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Fine-tune the pitch angle threshold (0.1) and anti-flip torque multiplier (100) based on testing
2. Consider adding a visual indicator showing when the anti-flip system is active
3. Possibly implement different anti-flip strengths based on vehicle speed
4. Extend the system to prevent side-flips as well during sharp turns
5. Create adjustable stabilization settings for different difficulty levels
