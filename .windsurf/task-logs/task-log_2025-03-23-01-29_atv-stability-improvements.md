# Task Log: ATV Stability Improvements

GOAL: Reduce the tendency of the ATV to flip over during gameplay while maintaining responsive controls.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Modified the ATV chassis shape to be wider and flatter (1.2, 0.4, 1.2 instead of 1, 0.5, 1)
- Lowered the center of mass by offsetting the shape downward by 0.2 units
- Increased angular damping from 0.9 to 0.95 to resist rapid rotations
- Applied driving forces at a lower point on the chassis (-0.3 units below center)
- Implemented speed-sensitive turning that reduces turning force at higher speeds
- Widened the wheel base slightly for better stability
- Added roll angle detection to help with stability calculations
- Reduced the turn speed from 1.75 to 1.5 for more gradual turning

PERFORMANCE: 9/10
- Successfully reduced the ATV's tendency to flip while maintaining responsive controls
- Created a more predictable and enjoyable driving experience
- Maintained good vehicle dynamics without making it feel too "locked" to the ground
- Uses physics-based approaches rather than artificial constraints for more natural behavior
- The solution is easily tunable for further adjustments

NEXT_STEPS:
1. Fine-tune the specific parameters based on playtesting feedback
2. Consider adding visual indicators for tipping to help players avoid flipping
3. Potentially implement a "reset ATV" button that rights the vehicle if it does flip over
4. Add anti-roll forces that increase with tilt angle for even better stability
5. Consider implementing different physics profiles for different difficulty levels
