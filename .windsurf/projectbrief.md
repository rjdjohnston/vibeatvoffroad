# Vibe ATV Off-road - Project Brief

## Project Overview
Vibe ATV Off-road is a 3D web-based ATV (all-terrain vehicle) simulation that allows users to drive an ATV through an off-road desert environment with various jumps and obstacles. The application features realistic physics, an oval race track, and interactive controls.

## Core Requirements
1. Interactive 3D ATV driving experience
2. Realistic physics simulation for vehicle movement and terrain interaction
3. Race track with jumps and obstacles
4. Visual effects including dust particles
5. Responsive controls for user engagement
6. Third-person camera that follows the vehicle

## Project Goals
1. Create an engaging and realistic off-road ATV driving experience
2. Implement realistic physics for vehicle behavior
3. Design an interesting track with varied obstacles
4. Deliver smooth performance and visual quality in a web browser

## Target Audience
- Casual gamers interested in off-road vehicles
- ATV enthusiasts
- Users looking for browser-based 3D experiences

## Technical Scope
- Browser-based application using WebGL
- 3D rendering with Three.js
- Physics simulation with Cannon.js
- 3D model loading with GLTFLoader
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
