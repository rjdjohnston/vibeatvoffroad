# Vibe ATV Off-road - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial setup and documentation of the project in the Windsurf Memory System
- Understanding the existing codebase structure and functionality
- Identifying potential areas for improvement or feature additions

## Recent Changes
- Created Windsurf Memory System documentation structure
- Performed initial codebase review and analysis
- Documented project architecture, patterns, and technical context

## Next Steps
- Identify specific improvements or features to implement
- Prioritize enhancements based on user experience impact
- Consider optimizations for performance, visual quality, or gameplay

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Code Organization
- Evaluate the current code structure and identify areas for potential refactoring
- Consider modularizing the codebase further for better maintainability
- Assess if additional scripts (script2.js, script_track_bkg.js) need to be better integrated

### Feature Enhancement Possibilities
- Improved terrain with height variations or additional textures
- More track obstacles or alternative track layouts
- Time tracking and lap counting functionality
- Mobile/touch controls support
- Sound effects and background music
- Additional vehicles or customization options

### Technical Improvements
- Physics tuning for more realistic ATV behavior
- Performance optimizations for broader device compatibility
- Improved visual effects (shadows, lighting, particles)
- Responsive design improvements for different screen sizes

### User Experience Considerations
- Clearer instructions or UI elements
- Visual feedback for jumps, speed, or achievements
- Camera options (first-person view, alternate angles)
- Track boundary indicators or guidance
