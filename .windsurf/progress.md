# Vibe ATV Off-road - Progress Document

## What Works
- **Core Rendering**: Three.js scene setup and rendering pipeline
- **Physics Integration**: Cannon.js physics world with gravity and collision detection
- **Vehicle Model**: ATV model loading and integration with physics
- **Track Layout**: Basic oval track with jumps and numbered obstacles
- **Vehicle Controls**: Keyboard input for steering, acceleration, and braking
- **Camera System**: Third-person camera that follows the ATV
- **Visual Effects**: Dust particle system that activates during movement
- **Environment**: Skybox with desert theme and textured ground plane
- **UI Elements**: Basic speedometer display
- **Reset Mechanism**: Automatic reset when ATV falls off track

## What's Left to Build
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls for mobile devices
- **Sound Effects**: Engine sounds, impact noises, ambient effects
- **Time Tracking**: Lap timer and best time recording
- **Expanded Track**: More varied and challenging terrain or obstacles
- **Game Mechanics**: Goals, challenges, or achievements
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improved loading and rendering efficiency
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Shadows, additional lighting effects, improved textures
- **UI Improvements**: Start screen, instructions, settings

## Current Status
The application is in a functional prototype state with core gameplay mechanics implemented. Users can drive the ATV around the track and experience the physics-based driving simulation with basic visual feedback.

### Key Accomplishments
- Successful integration of Three.js rendering with Cannon.js physics
- Implementation of realistic vehicle movement and controls
- Creation of a playable track with multiple jumps
- Visual effects that enhance the off-road experience

### Known Issues
- Physics tuning may need adjustment for optimal vehicle handling
- Camera sometimes positions sub-optimally when vehicle orientation changes rapidly
- Lack of mobile support limits accessibility
- No audio feedback reduces immersion
- Limited gameplay goals beyond driving around track

## Performance Evaluation
- **Rendering**: Good performance with current assets and effects
- **Physics**: Stable simulation with occasional edge cases during extreme maneuvers
- **User Experience**: Basic functionality is intuitive but lacks depth
- **Visual Quality**: Acceptable for prototype but room for enhancement
- **Code Structure**: Functional but could benefit from modularization

## Next Development Phase
Focus areas for the next development phase should include:
1. Gameplay enhancement (objectives, challenges)
2. Audio implementation
3. Mobile control support
4. Visual improvements
5. Performance optimization
